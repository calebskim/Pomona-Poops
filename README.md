# Pomona-Toilets
## Introduction
Pomona Toilets is a website that features an interactive guide and ratings on the restrooms around campus. Inspired by a conversation on accessibility, we wanted to address the inconsistencies between the restrooms on campus such as whether or not they have period products, paper towels, or sinks for wheelchairs to roll under. It is important to constantly evaluate our privileges as able-bodied people, including the ease and ability to use the restroom. Our website continues to further the conversation on accessibility and give more resources to students, faculty, and visiting in need.

## Features
* The website’s homepage displays buttons on the top right corner for users to interact with such as a map and ratings of the toilets. 
* The interactive map of Pomona’s campus displays buttons where the restrooms in buildings are located. By clicking on the button, it displays information such as the gender of the restrooms and inclusion of hand dryers and toilet seat cover dispensers. 
* The ratings page first displays the buildings of Pomona organized alphabetically and their purpose (dorms, academic, etc.) After clicking on a building, the user is able to rate and review one of its toilets accompanied by pictures of the restrooms.
